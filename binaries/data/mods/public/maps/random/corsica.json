		"Description" : "The players start on two opposing islands, both with a very jagged relief that will make landing difficult.\n\n\nCorsica is an island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is located west of Italy, southeast of the French mainland, and north of the island of Sardinia. Mountains comprise two-thirds of the island, forming a single chain. Sardinia is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea (after Sicily and before Cyprus). The nearest land masses are the island of Corsica, the Italian Peninsula, Sicily, Tunisia and the Balearic Islands. The coast of both islands is very rocky, their climate Mediterranean and both had a history of being colonized by Carthaginians and were both conquered by Romans.",
